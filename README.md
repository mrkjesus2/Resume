## About

This is a resume project that I completed for Udacity. This was the second project in the Front
End Nanondegree and was all about using Javascript/Jquery to Replace HTML placeholders with
information from JSON objects.

## Installation
- You probably don't want to
- Should your disagree, `git clone` the repo
- Run `gulp` on the command line in the root directory:
 - Starts a live reload webserver
 - Watch for file changes to JS/CSS/HTML and validate/lint
